# Magic-Number
 In this assignment, we ask you to print the p-magic numbers on the screen. For a number to be p-magic, it must meet the following conditions: Will be greater than p • It will have at least one divisor (remainder 0 when divided) between 2 and p (inclusive). • 1 more will not be divided into 3 Your program will start by first getting the number p from the user. The number p can be any number between 2 and 10 inclusive. You will then receive a second positive integer x from the user. After these two numbers are taken, you will print all p-magic numbers less than x on the screen.
